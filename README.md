# Hi, I'm Rijon Khan ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate beginner learning **Full Stack Web Development**.  
Currently building strong foundations in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and backend basics.  

My goal is to create real-world projects and grow into a confident full-stack developer.  
Here, youâ€™ll find my **practice projects**, experiments, and portfolio pieces as I learn step by step.
